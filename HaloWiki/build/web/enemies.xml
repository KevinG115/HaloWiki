	<race>
	<name>ELITE</name>
	<info>
	The Sanghelli race are the most feared among the covenant, 
	they joined the covenant before the unngoy, kig-yar and the 
	Jiralhanae. They are formidable opponents in battle, and are the highest ranking race among the covenant.

	<name> GRUNTS</name>
	
	
	<info>
	Grunts (or Unggoy) are small, aggressive members of The Covenant that are effective warriors
	in numbers and when led by Elites, but dramatically less dangerous when not in a cohesive group,
	often running away. Grunts are essentially cannon fodder for the Covenant; 
	they are sometimes known to stick live plasma grenades to themselves and charge at an enemy.
	Grunts were revelealed via Game Informer, and were shown in the E3 2012 Halo 4 campaign demo.

	<name>JACKALS</name>
	
	
	<info>
	Jackals were revealed in the E3 2012 gameplay demo, 
	and have been confirmed to be in the final game. 
	There have been confirmations of Jackal Snipers as well.


	There are three distinct races of Kig-Yar, which
	humans have termed Jackals, Skirmishers, and now the Storm Jackals.
	They serve as snipers, shock troopers, defensive fighters, and scouts
	within the Covenant due to their excellent senses of sight, smell, and hearing.

	<name> HUNTER</name>
	
	<info>
	The Mgalekgolo more commonly known as Hunters, 
	are a unique gestalt of smaller creatures known as Lekgolo, 
	which are tiny, orange, worm-like creatures that group together to exponentially
	increase their intelligence, strength, and maneuverability.

	<name> FORERUNNERS</name>
	
	<info>
	The Forerunners are an ancient race that came before the Covenant, 
	composed of an advanced and complex society. The Forerunners built
	an incredibly vast empire controlling most of the galaxy. It wasn't 
	long, however, until they came across the parasite force, known only 
	as the Flood. In a last resort attempt to save the all other races from 
	the Flood, they created the Halo rings, weapons of mass destruction
	designed to eliminate all sentient life. They detonated the halo rings, 
	destroying the Flood and themselves in the process.

	In the E3 2012 Halo 4 demo, Master Chief comes across Forerunner tech while 
	searching for the ship, Infinity. The Forerunners had very powerful technology 
	and some of their AI's and weaponry are very likely to appear in Halo 4 due to 
	it's setting on a Shield World (Named Requiem).

	<name> PROMETHEANS</name>
	
	
	<info>
	The Promeheans are humans turned into AI by the Didact to protect
	requiem; the Didact is the forerunner who acitvated the halo rings.

	The Prometheans feature a vast variety of different AI types with 
	sophisticated tactics, technology, and unique abilities, unconfirmed
	in halo 4; actual organic prometheans have not featured in gameplay
	footage (possibly wiped out by the firing of the halo arrays?). 
	The Promethean Knight appears to have 2 forms, One sporting a Light Rifle 
	and an ability to deploy Watchers, the other weilds a Scattershot and can 
	teleport forward to hit its target with it's blade. The second is called a 'Lancer'
	Variant as mentioned by a 343 employee during the IGN E3 demo. Also in some trailers 
	you can see Prometheans have blue lights instead of red although it is unclear if this 
	has any signfigance.
